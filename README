This program is used to run experiments with SuperTux + NEAT in parallel using GNU parallel.

To build, create a folder called "build" in the project's directory. Switch to the folder and call "cmake .." and then "make" to compile.
Afterwards, create a folder called "bin" inside of "build" and place the contents of the supertuxNEAT project inside. Build just like with this project and you're good to go.
The final path to the supertux2 executable should look like this: "<stneatexperimentfolder>/build/bin/build/supertux2".

Boost is required to run/compile this project. Supertux itself also has a few dependencies which you can check out in the official docs.

Following is a list of available parameters for experiment parameter files:

maxgens <int>                 Number of generations for which the simulation will run

numcores <int>			          Number of processes that are to be started, distributed on CPU's cores by GNU parallel

randseed <int>			          Seed to be used by MultiNEAT. This will override the seed given by "--seed".

numhiddenstartneurons <int>	  Amount of hidden neurons the initial genome should have

numrangesensors <int>		      Number of rangefinder sensors
lengthrangesensors <int>	    Length of rangefinder sensors

numdepthsensors <int>		      Number of depthfinder sensors
spacingdepthsensors <int>	    Spacing between depthfinder sensors
lengthdepthsensors <int>	    Length of depthfinder sensors

numpiesensors <int>		        Number of pieslice sensors to the right of Tux
radiuspieslicesensors <int>	  Radius of pieslice sensors
